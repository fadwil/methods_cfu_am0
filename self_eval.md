# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?

I am most proud of my ability to research on my own to solve the problems presented.

- What is the power of using methods in our applications?

A method can tell my code what to do during a particular set of circumstances. It is also an important component as it can be used as many times in my code as needed.
